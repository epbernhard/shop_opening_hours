In this notebook I show how to calculate opening hours of shops using a simple K-mean algorithm and anonymous pings of phones with time stamps. To calculate the opening hours, we look at the distribution of the numbers of pings in bins of time (representing the number of people in the shop), as well as its derivative. The latter represents the rate of change with time. By doing this, we can use K-mean clustering to isolate some sudden changes in these quantities, and deduce the opening and closing hours of shops.
